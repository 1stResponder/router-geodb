## FRESH Database Scripts

These are the database scripts required to run the FRESH router. The scripts create both the main FRESH database and the historical archive database for FRESH data.

**Requirements**

FRESH requires a PostgreSQL database. This can run on either a server (Linux or Windows) or a database service (Amazon's RDS, etc.).

**Instructions**
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the scripts in order (this can be done either via the command line or using the pgAdmin tool).
